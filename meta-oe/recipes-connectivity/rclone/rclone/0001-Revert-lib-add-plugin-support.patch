-## Writing a plugin ##
-
-New features (backends, commands) can also be added "out-of-tree", through Go plugins.
-Changes will be kept in a dynamically loaded file instead of being compiled into the main binary.
-This is useful if you can't merge your changes upstream or don't want to maintain a fork of rclone.
-
-Usage
-
- - Naming
-   - Plugins names must have the pattern `librcloneplugin_KIND_NAME.so`.
-   - `KIND` should be one of `backend`, `command` or `bundle`.
-   - Example: A plugin with backend support for PiFS would be called
-     `librcloneplugin_backend_pifs.so`.
- - Loading
-   - Supported on macOS & Linux as of now. ([Go issue for Windows support](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/19282))
-   - Supported on rclone v1.50 or greater.
-   - All plugins in the folder specified by variable `$RCLONE_PLUGIN_PATH` are loaded.
-   - If this variable doesn't exist, plugin support is disabled.
-   - Plugins must be compiled against the exact version of rclone to work.
-     (The rclone used during building the plugin must be the same as the source of rclone)
-     
-Building
-
-To turn your existing additions into a Go plugin, move them to an external repository
-and change the top-level package name to `main`.
-
-Check `rclone --version` and make sure that the plugin's rclone dependency and host Go version match.
-
-Then, run `go build -buildmode=plugin -o PLUGIN_NAME.so .` to build the plugin.
