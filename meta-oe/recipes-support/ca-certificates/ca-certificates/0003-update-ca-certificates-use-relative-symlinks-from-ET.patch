Subject: [PATCH] update-ca-certificates: use relative symlinks from
 $ETCCERTSDIR
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

update-ca-certificates symlinks (trusted) certificates
from $CERTSDIR or $LOCALCERTSDIR into $ETCCERTSDIR.
update-ca-certificates can call hook scripts installed
into /etc/ca-certificates/update.d. Those scripts are
passed the pem file in /etc/ssl/certs/ that was added or
removed in this run and those pem files are absolute
symlinks into $CERTSDIR or $LOCALCERTSDIR at the moment.

When running update-ca-certificates during image build
time, they thusly all point into the host's file system,
not into the $SYSROOT. This means:
* the host's file system layout must match the one
  produced by OE, and
* it also means that the host must have installed the same
  (or more) certificates as the target in $CERTSDIR and
  $LOCALCERTSDIR

This is a problem when wanting to execute hook scripts,
because they all need to be taught about $SYSROOT, and
behave differently depending on whether they're called
at image build time, or on the target, as otherwise they
will be trying to actually read the host's certificates
from $CERTSDIR or $LOCALCERTSDIR.

This also is a problem when running anything else during
image build time that depends on the trusted CA
certificates.

Changing the symlink to be relative solves all of these
problems. Do so.
