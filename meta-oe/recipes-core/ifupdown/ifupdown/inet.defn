method dhcp

    This method may be used to obtain an address via DHCP with any of
    the tools: dhclient, pump, udhcpc, dhcpcd.
    (They have been listed in their order of precedence.)
    If you have a complicated DHCP setup you should
    note that some of these clients use their own configuration files
    and do not obtain their configuration information via *ifup*.

    This method is used to create GRE or IPIP tunnels. You need to have

    IPIP tunnels.
