Subject: [PATCH] Try-out continu in hls to avoid blocking of main thread.

 Looks like the error self was false,
 If we just continue it retries,and
 the media just continues to play ok.
 The main advantage is that we avoid a
 main e2 thread blocked with stb freeze
 as result. Even if the media would stop,
 We do not have a frozen stb.
