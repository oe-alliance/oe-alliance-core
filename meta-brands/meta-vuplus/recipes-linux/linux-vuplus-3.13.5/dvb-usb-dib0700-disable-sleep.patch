Subject: [PATCH] linux-etxx00: fix build

Putting the dib7000p device in and out of sleep can trigger a race,
causing the usb device to stall (-EPIPE), resulting in i2c errors:

DiB0070 I2C write failed
DiB0070 I2C read failed

As a workaround, do not put the device to sleep

Perhaps the dib8000/9000 need the same workaround
